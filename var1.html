	<p>Cast me from my devils.<br>
	 Latch me to the sky.<br>
	 Skip me like a stone over the surface of this duck pond.<br>
	 Snap me like a switchblade.<br>
	 Stretch me as a slingshot.<br>
	 Throw me up like dust in a shaft of light.<br>
	 Drench me in your downpour.<br>
	 Put me on your compass.<br>
	 Walk me through cities of  the dead.<br>
	 Stitch me to your bones with sutures.<br>
	 Run me through the hourglass.<br>
	 Grind me into flour.<br>
	 Whisper me from your songbook.<br>
	 Keep my time in columns<br>
	 Add me to the ribs of your dome, and<br>
	 arch my back.</p>
